        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Daniel. I’ve just finished my first year at Kharkiv National University, Ukraine.
          My major of study is mathematics, but we get taught quite a bit of computer science as well.
          I have a passion for programming and I’ve participated in many CS olympiads and algorithmic contests (like ICPC)
          starting from school. Also I’m really fond of playing table tennis and badminton and also I enjoy freestyle roller skating.
          Apart from that, I play guitar (and try to learn to sing) and we've even established a cover band with my friends recently.
